# üìà Stock Price Prediction with Machine Learning

This repository contains a beginner-to-intermediate level project focused on predicting stock prices using Python and machine learning. It walks through the full process of downloading historical data, engineering features, training multiple models, and evaluating their performance ‚Äî all with a focus on making the concepts approachable and practical.

## üîç What I Did?

- How to fetch historical stock data using `yfinance`
- Feature engineering techniques including moving averages, returns, lagged features, and MACD
- How to scale and transform features for ML
- Training and comparing models like:
  - XGBoost
  - LightGBM
  - Neural Networks (with Keras)
- Stacking predictions to improve generalization
- Evaluating performance using metrics like MSE and R¬≤
- Visualizing model predictions vs. actual stock prices

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note

**Predicting stock prices is very hard.**

This project is a simplified and educational walkthrough ‚Äî not a financial product or a trading strategy. Real-world stock forecasting involves:

- Market sentiment, news, and macroeconomics
- Avoiding lookahead bias and leakage
- Risk management and transaction cost modeling
- More robust time-series validation

This notebook does **not** cover all of that. Instead, it's a clean introduction to ML applied to stock price data. Great for learning, not for live trading.
